# First Pipeline README

This is the first pipeline to be created in the Jenkins pipeline system. It is used to test the basic functionality of the system and to provide a basis for further development.

## What does it do?

This pipeline uses a Docker agent to run a Node.js environment. It then checks the version of Node.js installed.

## How to use it

To use this pipeline, simply run it in the Jenkins interface. The pipeline will execute the Docker agent and print the version of Node.js installed to the console.

## Known issues

There are no known issues with this pipeline.
